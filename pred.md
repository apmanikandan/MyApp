# How does it work?

Given a sequence of words , a statistical language model predicts the probability of upcoming words given the previous words.
 
Prepared corpus by stripping unwanted white space,converting to lower case,removing 'stopwords',digits,punctuations,control characters,removing profanity and Text stemming for the final tidy-up

The corpus was split into training ,devtest and test dataset samples. The model was trained on training data set and prediction /estimation of the next word is achieved.
